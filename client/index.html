                    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
                    <p>Our goal is to promote heightened awareness and to show that anything is possible 
                        if you believe it is. Self-awareness is having a clear perception of your 
                        personality, including strengths, thoughts, beliefs, motivation, and emotions. 
                        Developing self -awareness allows you to challenge your own beliefs by recognizing 
                        the harm they cause you and to others. Taking notice of what is going on within 
                        you physically and emotionally on a regular basis is crucial to pinpointing 
                        problems that are occurring within. 
                        We have listened to others our whole lives to the point that we have forgotten 
                        who we are.  We don't hear what is our "inner spirt" any longer.  
                        All we hear are the lessons we have been taught by others. 
                        We believe that we are limited, that we may be incapable. 
                        We were taught to judge and to be judged, so much that now we do it to ourselves. 
                        Taking note of your strengths and accomplishments is also a good way to challenge 
                        self defeating beliefs. 
                        We want to open the minds of those who use this application. 
                        By doing so we hope that they may be able to "connect the dots" 
                        and make some positive changes.
